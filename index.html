<h1>About yourself:</h1>
<h2><p>hey, I'm Aarish. My favourite thing to do is play videogames. I watch youtube/youtube shorts as well
as netfix. He likes reading books and tries to read at least an hour to an hour and a half. My nickname
given to him by his older brother (Swarit Mittal) is baby. I watches youtubers like Tewity, Superjombombo,
 socksreacts, socksfor3, socksfor2 and trippypepper. Inbestigators and boy girl cat mouse dog cheese (yes, the last 
5 words where one title). I enjoy some animes like one punch man, daily life of the immortal
king, how to  keep your mummy and the first 3 seasons of my hero acedamia. The videogames I play
on my phone are balloons tower defence 6 (btd6),  roblox and boomslingers. On my consoles (a switch
and a ps5) I play brawlhalla, minecraft, rec room and kikmetsu no yaiba, the hinokami chronicles (I normally
play this with my brother (I call him bubby)). </title></thead></p></h2></div>
